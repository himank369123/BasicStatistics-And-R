#Contents


This is an R Markdown document consisting basic methods oF *data analysis, stastical inFerence, data visualization* and some other data inbuilt Function oF R.
A large part oF the data and methods used in this document were taken From Foundation OF Data Analysis part-I From **edx** <https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UTAustinX+UT.7.11x+2T2017/course/>

#UniVariate Data:
Univariate means "one variable" (one type oF data)
Example: You weigh the pups and get these results:
1,3,4,6,8,10,12
The one variable is Puppy Weight

```{r }
pups=c(1,3,4,6,8,10,10)
```

##Measure OF Center In Univariate Data
* Mean:The arithmetic mean is the central value oF a discrete set oF numbers: speciFically, the sum oF the values divided by the number oF values.
```{r a1, echo=FALSE, Fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/himank/Desktop/markdown resources/meanFormula.png")
```









For our puppy weights data set mean is:
```{r}
mean(pups)
```

*Median:The median is the value separating the higher halF From the lower halF oF a data sample. For a data set, it may be thought oF as the "middle" value.
```{r a2, echo=FALSE, Fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/himank/Desktop/markdown resources/medianFormula.png")
```
For our puppy weights data set median is:
```{r}
median(pups)
```
*Mode:The mode oF a set oF data values is the value that appears most oFten.
For our puppy weights data set mode is:
```{r}
mode(pups)
```

## Shapes OF Distribuitions:
**1.Symmetric(Bell shaped)**: Unimode. Occurs in normal distributions. - when graphed, a vertical line drawn at the center will Form mirror images, with the leFt halF oF the graph being the mirror image oF the right halF oF the graph.
```{r a4 , echo=FALSE, Fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/himank/Desktop/markdown resources/symmetric.png")
```









**2.UniForm**: The data is spread equally across the range.
```{r a5 , echo=FALSE, Fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/himank/Desktop/markdown resources/uniForm.png")
```







**3.Right Skewed**(positively skewed): Fewer data plots are Found to the right oF the graph (toward the larger numeric values).
```{r a6, echo=FALSE, Fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/himank/Desktop/markdown resources/rightskewed.png")
```






**4.LeFt Skewed** (negatively skewed): Fewer data plots are Found to the leFt oF the graph (toward the smaller numeric values).
```{r a7, echo=FALSE, Fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/himank/Desktop/markdown resources/leFtskewed.png")
```





**5.Bimodal**: Usually has two modes.
```{r a8, echo=FALSE, Fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/himank/Desktop/markdown resources/bimodal.png")
```

##Creating a Frequency table For A variable:
```{r}
ptable=table(pups)
ptable
```

##Plotting Histogram For a Univariate Distribution:

```{r}
hist(pups,xlab='puppies',ylab='Frequency',main='no. oF puppies vs Freq')
```

##Range and Quartiles:
*Range: The range is simply the diFFerence between the smallest value (minimum) and the largest value (maximum) in the data.
In our puppies dataset range is:
```{r}
range(pups)
```

*Quartile: A quartile divides the data into Four approximately equal groups. The lower quartile,sometimes abbreviated as Q1 , is also know as the 25th percentile.The upper quartile, or Q3, is also know as the 75th percentile. 
We can get a summary oF our pups data in R  using summary() Function which inlcudes quartiles,min,max mean,median,etc..
```{r}
summary(pups)
```

*Interquartile Range: The interquartile range (IQR) is the range oF the data that contains the middle 50% oF cases. 
$IQR=Q3-Q1$

##five number summary:
The five number summary is a numerical description of a data set comprised of the following measures: min,lower quartile,median,upper quartile,max. 
```{r}
fivenum(pups)
```

##Box and whisker plots:

A box and whisker plot is a very convenient and informative way to diplay the info captured in the five number summary. A box and whisker plot shows the centers and spread of the values on a single quantative variable.

```{r , echo=FALSE, Fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/himank/Desktop/markdown resources/boxwhisker.png")
```


##Standard Deviation And Mean:
When data is normally Distributed, there are two preferred measures of center and spread. These are arithmetic mean and standard deviation.The **Standard Deviation** of  a data set tells us how it is spread out. The larger the standard deviation is,the more spread out data is.
A vertical line from inflectionn point to x-axis marks one standard deviation from the mean.Approx 68% of the data is located within one standard deviation of the mean.
For out pups data std dev is:
```{r}
sd(pups)
```


```{r , echo=FALSE, Fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/himank/Desktop/markdown resources/z.png")
```

##Variance:
**Variance** is also a measure of spread. It is simply the square of Standar Deviation.
For our pups data variance is:
```{r}
var(pups)
```

##Emperical Rule:
Emperical Rule states that the percentages of data in a normal distribution within 1,2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean are approximately 68%,95% and 99.7%.

```{r , echo=FALSE, Fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/himank/Desktop/markdown resources/empirical.png")
```

###Z-Score:
A **z-score** is a measure of the number of standard deviations a particular data point is away from the mean.
$$z=Deviation/Standard Deviation$$

#Bivariate Data:
Bivariate Data is data set with two variables (quantative or categorical).
**Correlation** measures the linear relationship between two quantative variables.
